        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, like the character set or the title of the tab.</li>
          <li>The body element contains information that is typically visible to the user, such as plain text, headers, and lists (like this one!)</li>
          <li>The body frequently contains semantic elements (elements that describe their own use like h1, which is the largest, or primary, header). Utilizing these when possible is important for accessability tools like screen readers.</li>
          <li>We can name (ID), as well as group (class), elements so they can be easily accessed by other languages like CSS or JS.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to add styling to our HTML, such as color, size, and location amongst other things.</li>
          <li>CSS is primarily comprised of a selector (the element(s) we're interacting with), and a property followed by a value - such as color: blue;</li>
          <li>Padding is responsible for the space between the content and the border.</li>
          <li>Border wraps around the padding of an element, quite literally defining the border of it.</li>
          <li>Margin is responsible for the buffer space between an element, and everything around it. While not technically part of the element, it is tied to an individual element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git, which is primarily controlled through the terminal (e.g. git bash or command prompt), allows for a user to easily version-control their projects with the help of Github on the web. Git has a great deal of commands, but some common and important ones follow.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on, as well as if we have any changes that we haven't pushed to Github.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch with the given name and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name switches to the given branch.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Pulls any new commits on the main branch and merges them into your currently checked-out branch.</li>
          <li>git push: Pushes changes from your local environment to Github</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: Pushes changes from the current local branch to the main remote branch on Github. This is typically finalized with a pull request.</li>
          <li>Pull request: A request to finalize and submit a change you've pushed from your local environment to the remote environment. Changes are then usually reviewed by other programmers working on the project.</li>
